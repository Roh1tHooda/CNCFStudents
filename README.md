- ## About

[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) is a [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) project founded in 2015 to help advance container technology and align the tech industry around its evolution. It was announced alongside [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) 1.0, an open-source container cluster manager, contributing to the Linux Foundation by Google as a seed technology.

- ## Mission of CNCF

The mission of CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) is to make cloud-native ubiquitous. Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone. Cloud native allows IT and software to move faster. Adopting cloud native technologies and practices enables companies to create software in-house, allows business people to closely partner with IT people, keep up with competitors and deliver better services to their customers. CNCF technologies enable cloud portability without vendor lock-in.

- ## Getting Involved with CNCF as a Student

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a community-driven organization that fosters the adoption of cloud-native computing technologies. As a student, there are many ways to get involved with CNCF and contribute to the community. Here are some resources to help you get started:

1. Join the CNCF Slack

The CNCF Slack is a great place to connect with other community members and stay up-to-date on the latest news and events. You can join the CNCF Slack by filling out this form.

2. Attend CNCF Events

CNCF hosts a number of events throughout the year, including KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, the largest gathering of the cloud-native community. Attending these events is a great way to meet other community members, learn about the latest technologies, and get involved with CNCF. You can find a list of upcoming events on the CNCF Events page.

3. Explore CNCF Projects

CNCF hosts a number of open-source projects, including Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Envoy. These projects are a great way to get hands-on experience with cloud-native technologies and contribute to the community. You can find a list of CNCF projects on the CNCF Projects page.

4. Contribute to CNCF Projects

If you're interested in contributing to CNCF projects, there are many ways to get involved. You can start by exploring the project's documentation, participating in the project's community meetings, or submitting bug reports and feature requests. You can find more information on contributing to CNCF projects on the CNCF Contribution Guide.

5. Apply for CNCF Scholarships and Programs

CNCF offers a number of scholarships and programs for students, including the CNCF CommunityBridge Program and the CNCF Diversity Scholarship Program. These programs are designed to help students gain hands-on experience with cloud-native technologies and contribute to the community. You can find more information on CNCF scholarships and programs on the CNCF Scholarships and Programs page.

By getting involved with CNCF as a student, you can gain valuable experience with cloud-native technologies, meet other community members, and contribute to the open-source community.
